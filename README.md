The purpose of this project is to design and implement a Hospital Management System (HMS) that streamlines hospital operations by digitising patient registration, appointment scheduling, and medical record management. This system aims to enhance the efficiency of administrative processes, improve patient care, and ensure secure handling of sensitive data. By integrating various modules for administrators, doctors, patients, and receptionists, the system seeks to provide a comprehensive solution for modern healthcare facilities. It facilitates easy access to information, improves communication among stakeholders, and supports quick decision-making in a clinical setting.


The scope of the Hospital Management System encompasses key functionalities tailored to the needs of healthcare providers and patients. The system includes:

- Patient Registration: This feature allows patients to enter and store their personal and medical information securely in the system, creating a digital record for easy retrieval and updates.
- Appointment Management: The system enables patients to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments with doctors, ensuring that they have access to timely care. It also allows doctors to manage their schedules efficiently.
- User Roles: The HMS implements distinct modules for administrators, doctors, receptionists, and patients. Each role has specific permissions and functionalities, ensuring that users can access only the information pertinent to their responsibilities.
- Data Security: Patient and medical data are protected through robust authentication mechanisms, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Encryption methods are also applied to safeguard data integrity.
- Real-Time Updates: The system provides users with timely information regarding appointments, the availability of doctors, and medical prescriptions, facilitating effective communication and operational efficiency.

This project is designed for implementation in hospitals and healthcare facilities of varying sizes, aiming to improve operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.
